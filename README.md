<hr>

I have developed stopwatch using Android. It can be start and stop by pressing buttons, so that one can measure exactly how long something takes to accomplished.

Here's why:
* This Application is light and easy to use.
* It is simple to use.....

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use `activity_main.xml` to get started with frontend.

Use `MainActivity.java` to get started with backened.
